Problem 1
Use the Auto MPG dataset. First, select continuous features such as mpg and displacement, handle the missing values in them, and then standardize the data. Next, use the hierarchical clustering method to divide the data into 3 clusters. By calculating the mean and variance of each cluster, as well as using cross - tabulation and heatmaps, it is found that cars produced in the United States have distinct characteristics in the clustering and are easy to distinguish from cars from other countries. However, cars from Europe and Japan are not easily distinguishable because some of their features are similar.
Problem 2
Use the California Housing dataset. Apply the K - Means clustering algorithm, try different numbers of clusters, and judge that the best result is achieved when the data is divided into 2 clusters according to the Silhouette score. Also, calculate the feature means and centroid coordinates of each cluster.
Problem 3
Use the Wine dataset. Through the K - Means clustering algorithm, set the number of clusters to 3, and use two metrics, homogeneity and completeness, to evaluate the clustering effect. To run these codes, Python and relevant libraries need to be installed in advance.
